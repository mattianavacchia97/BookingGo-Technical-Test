### Part 1
For running the first console application, using Intellij, specify this line:

```
dave 51.470020,-0.454295 3.410632,-2.157533
```

For running the second console application, using Intellij, specify this line: 
```
all 51.470020,-0.454295 3.410632,-2.157533 5
```

(the last parameter is the number of passengers)

### Part 2
For running this part of the test, using Intellij, specify one of the following two lines:
```
dave 51.470020,-0.454295 3.410632,-2.157533 api
```

```
all 51.470020,-0.454295 3.410632,-2.157533 5 api
```
